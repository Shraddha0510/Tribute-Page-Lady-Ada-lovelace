          <h2>Ada Lovelace: The First Computer Programmer</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Born in England on December 10, 1815, Ada was the daughter of the famous poet Lord George Byron and his wife, Lady Anne Byron.
                a 19th century woman of many talents but with a particular leaning towards mathematics.
                 She is commonly regarded as the world’s first programmer based on her work with Charles Babbage on his Analytical Engine.
                  Her choice to study and specialize in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics 
                  (STEM) disciplines was highly exceptional for a woman in 19th century England, 
                  but she had an excellent role model in her mother, Anne Isabella (Milbanke) Byron.
                   Lady Byron was herself a woman of high intellect with a passion for mathematics – Lord Byron called her
                    the “Princess of Parallelograms” – and she strongly encouraged Ada in her studies.

          <ul>
            <li>
                In 1843 Lovelace translated a French paper that Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea wrote about the Analytical Engine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lovelace realized that the Analytical Engine could carry out an extensive sequence of mathematical operations.
            </li>
            <li>
                The example she wrote of one such sequence—how to calculate Bernoulli numbers—is regarded by computer historians as the first computer program. 
            </li>
            <li>
                She even speculated that the Analytical Engine could be used to perform operations on "other things besides number," such as musical notes.
            </li>
            <li>
                The idea of a machine that could manipulate symbols in accordance with rules and that number could represent entities other than quantity mark the fundamental transition from calculation to computation.
            </li>
            <li>
                She has been referred to as 'prophet of the computer age'. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The computer language Ada, created on behalf of the United States Department of Defense, was named after Lovelace.
            </li>
            <li>
                Every year on the second Tuesday in October, the contributions of women to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are celebrated on Ada Lovelace Day.
